# ltwitter-cli
**little twitter cli.**

script in python I've made long ago. tweet, search users posts, check your account info, send messages, upload pictures, update your picture from profile...

you'll need to insert your api credentials on `twitter.py`: 

```python3
consumer_key = ''
consumer_secret = ''

access_token = ''
access_token_secret = ''
```
